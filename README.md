# Personal-website

This is an opportunity to learn about web development, specifically using Javascript and having the ability to be creative with CSS, I'll be adding as I learn more.

The website is hosted at: https://www.joshua-tustanowski.xyz/ using Netifly.


# TODO

1. Add an about page
  a. Simple introduction
  b. Could implement an interactive timeline/CV like we've seen before
2. Add a portfolio's page
  a. Display only 3 projects
  b. Maybe have a toggle to switch between projects, or just use a grid?
3. Add a contacts page
  a. Use a form to collect details, send the information as an email to me with a message receipt to the client
  b. Store users in a database for emailing
